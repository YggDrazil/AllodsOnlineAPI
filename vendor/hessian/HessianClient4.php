/**
 * <BLOCKQUOTE>
 * Proxy that allows RPC method calls to a remote Hessian compatible web-service
 * It requires the url of the Hessian service. Tested against Java and PHP services.
 * 
 * It uses the overload extension of PHP 4 to execute the remote calls. PHP 5 supports overloading
 * natively. If your PHP installation doesn't support overload, you can use direct calls to the __call() 
 * method using the arguments as detailed in <A HREF="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.overload.php">http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ref.overload.php</A> 
 * or in the documentation of this class
 * <BR>
 * Sample usage:<BR>
 * <BR>
 * <code>
 * $testurl = 'http://www.caucho.com/hessian/test/basic';<BR>
 * $proxy = &new HessianClient($testurl);<BR>
 * echo $proxy->hello();<BR>
 * </code>
 * <BR>
 * <B>WARNING:</B> As in PHP 4.3.x, all method name metadata (get_class_methods(), overload extension __call()) is internally 
 * lower-cased so if you call a camel case remote method name, like 'getUsers', the call will result into a no such
 * method fault because PHP will interpret the method name as 'getusers'. This is especially bad when calling Java
 * services where many method names are camel cased. Sad but true.<BR>
 * <BR>
 * To counterfeit this, use {@link HessianPHP.Hessian#remoteMethod remoteMethod()}  in the proxy object to tell Hessian how to call the method with the 
 * right name before executing the call. PHP 5 doesn't seem to be affected by this behavior.
 * <BR>
 * <BR>TODO: 
 * <UL>
 *	<LI>SSL support</LI>
 *	<LI>gzip compression?</LI>
 *	<LI>Enhance error handling and test, test, test...</LI>
